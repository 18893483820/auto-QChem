# auto-QChem

A series of functions for the automated generation, submission, and analysis of large batches of quantum chemistry calculations. The goal of this project is to develop tools for the automated computation of chemical, thermochemical, and steric features of molecules for use in machine learning and data science applications in chemistry.

Dependencies:
- Windows
- Open-Babel 2.4.1
- Mathematica (Written using 11.1)

Notes:
- The computation input generation functions were written to work this particular directory structure (b/c I really only wrote this with my personal use in mind). So copy the entire folder over and place ChemDraw and SMILES to generate from in the corresponding data subdirectory.

 WE MIGHT AS WELL ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE A NEW PLANET 
 INTO THE SOLAR SYSTEM, OR TO ANNIHILATE ONE ALREADYIN EXISTENCE, 
 AS TO CREATE OR DESTROY A PARTICLE OF HYDROGEN.
 ALL THE CHANGES WE CAN PRODUCE CONSIST IN SEPARATING PARTICLES
 THAT ARE IN A STATE OF ... COMBINATION, AND JOINING 
 THOSE THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY AT A DISTANCE.

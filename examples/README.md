# auto-QChem

A series of functions for the automated generation, submission, and analysis of large batches of quantum chemistry calculations. The goal of this project is to develop tools for the automated computation of chemical, thermochemical, and steric features of molecules for use in machine learning and data science applications in chemistry.

# Examples
- DFT computation input from a list of SMILES strings
- DFT computation input from a ChemDraw file
- DFT computation input with automated conformation analysis
- Descriptor matrix generation from computational output
